Hardcore Revival
---------------

You have received this book because you're probably mourning the loss of your dear friend, <DeadPerson>.

However, not all hope is lost just yet! Read the following pages to learn why.<PageBreak>

While this world is pretty hardcore, someone felt merciful enough to let you revive your friends using a special ritual.
It might be a little costly and just a tad dangerous, but it's absolutely worth it.<PageBreak>

Locating Corpses
---------------

In order to perform the revival ritual, you first of all need the head of the player who died.
The head can be found below the ground at their death location, usually marked by a red tulip.

If you don't know where your friend died, use an anvil to name <LocatorItem> after them and then burn that item.
A magical orb will fly off into the general direction of the corpse. Repeat this until you found it.<PageBreak>
