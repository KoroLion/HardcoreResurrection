# HardcoreRevival
Minecraft Mod. Adds a configurable revival ritual for dead friends in Hardcore mode. Server-side only. Originally made for ZeekDaGeek's Hardcore Subserver.

### Notes
- This mod was originally made for ZeekDaGeek's FTB Departed Hardcore Subserver because we wanted a chance to get back in after dieing while still keeping the hardcore experience and having deaths be painful. It was made completely server-side-only so that players wouldn't need to install any additional mods. It turned out to be fun having to send rescue teams to retrieve the player head from dead player corpses, so I fleshed the mod out and made it fully configurable. Hopefully this will make having Hardcore servers more viable.
- Ritual structures are defined in .json files. See Goldman.json for the default structure, which is two gold blocks with the head on top, activated by a golden apple.
- Server-side only - no need to have it on clients
- Highly customizable - define ritual structure as well as costs and penalties
- Locate player corpses by burning a specific (configurable) item named after them
- Player Head spawns below the ground on death (necessary for the revival ritual)
- Revival Instruction Book when a player dies
- Debugging Tools for configuring a ritual: /hardcorerevival spawnritual and /hardcorerevival debug
